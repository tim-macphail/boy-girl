# Solve the boy-girl paradox
A simple Python script that simulates the [Boy or Girl Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_or_Girl_paradox)
The script simulates 1000 repetitions of the experiment and prints the probability of both children being a girl, given that the child opening the door is a girl.
